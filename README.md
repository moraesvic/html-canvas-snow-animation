This is an animation done with HTML Canvas used as a learning project for animations within the browser and JS code profiling and optimization. It also tries to simulate the physics of snow particles falling into a windy atmosphere by means of a discretization of the equations of motion.

To try it out, just deliver the contents of the `public` folder with a static server.

**Bonus points**: the animation also comes with an audio file to get you more into a wintery mood. The audio track is "Mr. Moustafa", by Alexandre Desplat and is part of the original soundtrack of The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014). All rights go to the original copyright holders.
