This is an animation done with HTML Canvas used as a learning project for animations within the browser and JS code profiling and optimization. It also tries to simulate the physics of snow particles falling into a windy atmosphere by means of a discretization of the equations of motion.

To try it out, just deliver the contents of the `public` folder with a static server.
